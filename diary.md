# Baltimore County Building and Address Import Complete

Over the course of the past few months, I embarked on a project to import address and building footprint data for [Baltimore County, Maryland, USA]. Baltimore County has a population over over 830,000 (est. 2014) putting it ahead of Alaska, D.C., North Dakota and Vermont. The import consisted of 285,000+ unique addresses and 294,000+ buildings.
